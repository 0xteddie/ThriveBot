# ThriveBot

## Description

This project is a bot used to track progress over time using data, with a primary focus on weight training and measuring muscle growth and training performance. It is designed for personal use as well as for friends and family who want to track their own weight-training progress.

In addition, it uses a calendar-based system to assign habits and tasks to specific days and mark them as completed. These habits can include reading, maintaining a caloric deficit, managing carb intake, and other small habits a user wants to build. Completion is displayed using a ✔️ on the calendar along with abbreviations to indicate status.

**Possible Future:** Will also includes money-management features such as budgeting and automatically transferring money from a checking account into savings to reduce friction and repeated decision-making.


## Mission
This project exists to make progress and consistency in weight training, habits, and personal growth visible and actionable over time, reducing friction and mental load so that steady improvement becomes natural for users.

**Key principle:** Any new feature or change should support progress, consistency, or reduce friction.
